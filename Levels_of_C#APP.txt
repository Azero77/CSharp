C# is just a collection of classes running and behaving with each other...
but we need some way to have a group of classes for a specific goal and another group for another goal...
so here comes "namespaces":
	they are containers for c# classes
	for ex:
		we have a namespace for working with databases and another
		namespace for working with security and so on...
in the same way we come up with "assemblies"(dll or exe)
NOTE:dll stands for dynamic link library...
in the end:
	C# app is a set of assemblies...
and the "solution" is a container for c# projects...
